# AnimCurves
This is a quick header only file implementation of very common animation curves used in games. By simply passing in time into one of the given in a unit value from 0 to 1 users can sample a desired animation curve. A helper funciton, GetCurveByIndex, is added so that users may pass in an id and the unit value for ease of use.
